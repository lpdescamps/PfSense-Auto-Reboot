# PfSense-Auto-Reboot
A simple script to reboot you pfsense box while there is not internet.

To test the the Scipt on your local pfsence/BSD machine.
1. Install bash if not installed already. Use the command "pkg install bash".
2. Change permisson to executable. Use the command "chmod +x PfReboot.sh".
3. Run it as "bash pfreboot.sh".



Long Story Short pfsense does not like my PPPoE isp.
