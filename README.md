# PfSense-Auto-Reboot
A simple script to reboot you pfsense box while there is not internet.

To test the the Scipt on your local pfsence/BSD machine.
1. Install bash if not installed already. 
```     
pkg install bash
```
2. Change permisson to executable.
``` chmod +x PfReboot.sh
```
3. Run it as "bash pfreboot.sh".
```
bash pfreboot.sh
```

Long Story Short pfsense does not like my PPPoE isp.
